STATUS REPORT 3 TEAM 1

Status Report 3:
       1)We had another weekly meeting to discuss what we needed from each team in terms of actions on the page, 
       information from the server, etc. We are also debating removing some aspects of our project after considering 
       Ming saying that a simple but well done/working project is preferred over a lot of buggy features. One example 
       that's on the chopping block includes the graphical representation of the player's progress and ranking. Rather, 
       we will focus our work on ensuring the leaderboard, login, and match-making work. We continued to work in smaller 
       groups to build the individual parts of the project before we put it all together. In the past week, a lobby for
       matchmaking has been created and is in the process of being designed. Building of the game continues with a 
       couple of issues (mentioned below).
       2) In building the game, we ran into some problems regarding the grid. We are currently debating removing the 
       grid idea entirely and letting the player move more freely, and we hope to have a better idea of how that will 
       work when we next meet.
       3) With a week and a half left and many semester projects finishing in the next couple of days, we plan to make 
       a major push in terms of progress over the next week. Finishing game mechanics, wrapping up design, and connecting 
       the UI buttons/actions and displays with the server information will be major accomplishments we plan on executing.

* Good chopping things
* "{“username”: “attackerman”, “password”: “Very Secure Password”, “wins”: 6, “losses”: 7, “ELO”:1452, “Past_Games”: [{“opponent”: “other_username”, “win”: true, “opponent ELO”: 1400}, /*all past games */]}" => from your status 2, how do you add to the past games?  Doesn't look like good design at a glace...
