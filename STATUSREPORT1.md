Status report 1:

1. This past week we discussed the game details (turn by turn vs concurrent live actions) as well as better established the rules and actions of the game. After determining how our game would work, we diagrammed the steps (client input, post, then server response, update to both players, etc.) needed for our game to work. This is a rough draft given we aren't fully familiarized with all the steps required for two clients to communicate with the server. Furthermore, we delegated who will be completing each aspect of the final project and we began with our individual tasks.

2. We encountered challenges with phaser, specifically when implementing with our HTML doc. Additionally, we are having some difficulty with our server communication to the HTML.

3. For this next week, we hope to get basic communication with our HTML and phaser working so that we see our client inputs influence the page display. Furthermore, we would like to be able to store and retrieve user info from our servers so we can calculate user stats and other usersâ€™ stats (to display leader board and individual progress of the player).
